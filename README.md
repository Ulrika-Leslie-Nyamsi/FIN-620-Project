Exploring Cryptocurrency Returns: Descriptive Statistics and Factor Analysis Within a Portfolio Context
This study explores cryptocurrency portfolio analysis using sophisticated statistical and econometric methods, focusing on both univariate and bivariate factor-based approaches from 2017 to 2022. Through descriptive statistics, factor modeling, and risk assessment techniques within the Fama-French three-factor model framework, insights into cryptocurrency returns and risk profiles are unveiled. The analysis categorizes portfolios based on percentiles and statistical measures, revealing varying risk-return profiles across different cryptocurrency investment strategies. The bivariate analysis evaluates portfolio exposures to market, size, and value factors over rolling 12-day periods, highlighting their influence on portfolio performance. Key findings emphasize the significance of specific factors (bMkt, bhml, bsmb) in explaining returns, guiding risk management strategies and factor allocation decisions. This empirical research contributes to factor-driven investment strategies, validating the impact of market dynamics and fundamental valuation metrics on cryptocurrency returns, aiding investors in constructing optimized portfolios and confidently navigating the dynamic cryptocurrency market landscape.
